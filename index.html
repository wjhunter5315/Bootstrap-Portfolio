                    <p>
                        I grew up in Mobile, Alabama where my interests mostly involved
                        sports. I began in Little League baseball, then transitioned into
                        tennis. I played for several years until an elbow injury kept me off
                        the court. I then followed some friends into soccer where I found a
                        love for the 'beautiful game'. After highschool graduation I atended
                        Birmingham-Southen College, a private liberal arts school, where I
                        recieved a B.A. in English.
                    </p>
              
                    <p>
                        After college I had various jobs before I found a calling as a brewer.
                        I had always had an interest in cooking, and brewing has many
                        overlaps. Through my brewing experience I have come to find an
                        appreciation for the diversity of beer given the vast majority is made
                        of only four ingredience; water, malt, hops, and yeast.
                    </p>

                        I moved back to Los Angeles in April after helping a brewpub open in
                        my hometown. Iron Hand Brewing is an English style brewpub that makes
                        small batch ales and serves classic pub fare, all made in-house. The
                        brewery scene in Los Angeles is sprawling, but competetive. This has
                        led me to seek other options in the web development field.
